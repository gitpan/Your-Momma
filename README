NAME
    Your::Momma - I don't like the name of the module.


======================================================================
SYNOPSIS
        use Your::Momma;

        print your_momma(), "\n";

DESCRIPTION
    People often post module proposals to Perl forums and newsgroups.
    Usually these proposals will include working code. Occasionally the code
    will include something genuinely new or innovative or useful. Even when
    it doesn't it usually represents a significant effort by the author.

    However, this effort or innovation or utility is generally ignored.
    Instead, the most frequent comment to a new module proposal is "I don't
    like the name of the module".

    That isn't surprising. Often the author doesn't like the name of the
    module either. But having gone to the trouble of writing code,
    documentation, tests and putting together a distribution they deserve
    something more insightful than "I don't like the name of the module".

    In order to avoid this debate and perhaps generate some useful comments
    it is recommended that all new module proposals use the working title
    Your::Momma. Then the dialog can proceed as follows:

    Reviewer: "I don't like the name of the module".

    Author: "Your::Momma".

FAQ
    Q. Shouldn't this module be in the "Acme::" namespace?

    A. Your::Momma.


======================================================================
SEE ALSO
    The second most frequent comment to a new module proposal is that a
    module already exists that does the same thing.

    In these cases use the module "See::Also".
